# quarto (development version)

# quarto 1.4

- This version is now adapted to Quarto 1.4 latest stable release.

- Add registration of vignette engine to use `quarto` as a vignette builder, and use `.qmd` file as vignette. See `vignette("hello", package = "quarto")`. (thanks, @dcnorris, #57).

- New `quarto_binary_sitrep()` checks possible difference in Quarto binary used by this package, and the one used by RStudio IDE (thanks, @jthomasmock, #12).

- New `is_using_quarto()` to check if a directory requires using Quarto (i.e. it has a `_quarto.yml` or at least one `*.qmd` file) (thanks, @hadley, #103).

- New `quarto_create_project()` calls `quarto create project <type> <name>` (thanks, @maelle, #87).

- New `quarto_add_extension()` and `quarto_use_template()` to deal with Quarto extensions for a Quarto project. (thanks, @mcanouil, #45, @remlapmot, #42).

- `quarto_render()` and `quarto_inspect()` gains a `profile` argument (thanks, @andrewheiss, #95, @salim-b, #123).

- `quarto_render()` gains `metadata` and `metadata_file` arguments. They can be used to pass modified Quarto metadata at render time. If both are set, `metadata` will be merged over `metadata_file` content. Internally, metadata will be passed as a `--metadata-file` to `quarto render` (thanks, @mcanouil, #52, @maelle, #49).

- `quarto_render()` and all other relevant functions gain a `quarto_args` argument. It allows to pass additional options flag to `quarto` CLI. This is for advanced usage e.g. when new options are added to Quarto CLI that would not be user-facing in this package's functions (thanks, @gadenbuie, #125).

- Add `quiet` argument in most functions to remove warnings and messages. It default to `FALSE` in most function to match with `quarto` CLI default.

- In `quarto_render()`, `execute_params` now converts boolean value to `true/false` correctly as expected by `quarto render` (thanks, @marianklose, #124).

- Error message now advises to re-run with `quiet = FALSE` because `quarto_render(quiet = TRUE)` will run `quarto render` in quiet mode (thanks to @gadenbuie, #126, @wlandau, #16).

- **rsconnect** R package dependency has been moved to Suggest to reduce this package's overall number of dependencies. **rsconnect** package is only required for publishing using `quarto_publish_*()` functions. Users will be prompted to install (when in interactive mode) if not installed.

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
