\title{Get the root of the currently running Quarto project}
\usage{
get_running_project_root()
}
\value{
Character Quarto project root path from set environment variables.
}
\description{
This function is to be used inside cells and will return the project root
when doing \code{\link[=quarto_render]{quarto_render()}} by detecting Quarto project environment variables.
}
\details{
Quarto sets \code{QUARTO_PROJECT_ROOT} and \code{QUARTO_PROJECT_DIR} environment
variables when executing commands within a Quarto project context (e.g.,
\verb{quarto render}, \verb{quarto preview}). This function detects their presence.

Note that this function will return \code{NULL} when running code interactively
in an IDE (even within a Quarto project directory), as these specific
environment variables are only set during Quarto command execution.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# This will be TRUE during `quarto render` in a project
get_running_project_root()

# This will be FALSE when not running during `quarto_render` (e.g. interactively)
get_running_project_root()
}
}

\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=find_project_root]{find_project_root()}} for finding the Quarto project root directory
\item \code{\link[=project_path]{project_path()}} for constructing paths relative to the project root
