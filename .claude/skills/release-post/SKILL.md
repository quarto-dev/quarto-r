  Use when the user needs to: (1) Write a release announcement blog post for an R or Python package
  for tidyverse.org or shiny.posit.co, (2) Transform NEWS/changelog content into blog format,
  (3) Generate acknowledgments sections with contributor lists, (4) Format posts following specific

# Package Release Post

Create professional R/Python package release blog posts following Tidyverse or Shiny blog conventions.

## Quick Start

1. **Identify the blog platform**: Tidyverse (tidyverse.org) or Shiny (shiny.posit.co)
2. Verify NEWS.md or changelog exists for the package
3. Gather package info: name, version, repository (e.g., "tidyverse/dplyr")
4. Follow the workflow below
5. Use `scripts/get_contributors.R` to generate acknowledgments
6. Reference the appropriate formatting guide for final polish

## Platform Selection

This skill supports two blog platforms with different formatting requirements:

- **Tidyverse blog** (tidyverse.org)
  - Uses hugodown
  - R packages primarily
  - More rigid structure and conventions
  - See `references/tidyverse-formatting.md`

- **Shiny blog** (shiny.posit.co)
  - Uses Quarto
  - R and Python packages
  - More flexible, feature-focused structure
  - See `references/shiny-formatting.md`

**First, determine which platform the post is for**, then follow the general workflow and apply platform-specific formatting.

## General Workflow

These steps apply to both platforms. Content guidelines are based on Tidyverse best practices but adapt them as needed for Shiny posts.

### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect required information:

- **Platform**: Tidyverse or Shiny blog?
- **Package name and version**: e.g., "dplyr 1.2.0" or "shiny 1.9.0"
- **Repository**: GitHub repo in "owner/repo" format
- **Package language**: R or Python
- **NEWS content**: Read the package's NEWS.md, CHANGELOG, or NEWS
- **Package description**: One-sentence core purpose
- **Previous release tag**: For contributor fetching (optional)
- **Featured image**: For frontmatter (optional but recommended)

### Step 2: Structure the Post

Create the post outline following this order:

1. **Frontmatter**: Platform-specific YAML (see formatting references)

2. **Title and Opening**:
   - Title: Package name and version
   - Opening: Announcement with one-sentence package description
   - Installation: Code block with installation command
   - Overview: Brief summary with link to full release notes

3. **Main Content** (choose appropriate sections):
   - **Migration guide** (if breaking changes) - Always first when present
   - **Lifecycle changes** (deprecations, soft-deprecations, defunct)
   - **Feature sections** (one per major feature, descriptive headings)
   - **Minor improvements** (bulleted list)

4. **Acknowledgements** (when appropriate):
   - Use `scripts/get_contributors.R`
   - Format: "A big thank you to all the folks who helped make this release happen:"
   - Comma-separated GitHub links

### Step 3: Apply Content Guidelines

Follow the best practices in `references/content-guidelines.md`:

- **Opening style**: "We're [random adjective expressing excitement] to announce the release of..."
- **Section organization**: Migration → Lifecycle → Features → Improvements → Acknowledgements
- **Tone**: Conversational, professional, enthusiastic but authentic
- **Technical precision**: Use exact function names in backticks
- **Focus on benefits**: Explain "why" not just "what"
- **Code examples**: Realistic, well-commented, properly formatted

### Step 4: Transform NEWS Content

Convert NEWS.md bullets to blog-friendly content:

- **Research features thoroughly**: Don't just copy NEWS bullets—read function docs, check PRs, understand the context
- **Expand context**: Why changes matter, not just what changed
- **Add complete code examples**: Show realistic usage with full workflows, not just function signatures
- **Explain concepts first**: For unfamiliar features, explain what they are and how they work before showing code
- **Group thematically**: Combine related NEWS items into coherent sections
- **Use conversational tone**: Transform terse bullets into prose
- **Link documentation**: Add relevant links to docs and resources
- **Highlight breaking changes**: Make migration paths clear
- **Multi-language parity** (Shiny only): For R+Python packages on the Shiny blog, ensure all examples show both languages in tabsets

### Step 5: Apply Platform-Specific Formatting

**For Tidyverse posts**, read `references/tidyverse-formatting.md` and apply:
- hugodown frontmatter with `slug`, `photo.url`, `photo.author`
- Specific slug format: `packagename-x-y-z` (hyphens replace dots)
- R code blocks with `r` language identifier
- Acknowledgements always included as final section

**For Shiny posts**, read `references/shiny-formatting.md` and apply:
- Quarto frontmatter with YAML anchors for social media
- Flexible title formatting
- Use tabsets for Python/R or Express/Core variations
- Platform-specific code block attributes
- Acknowledgements optional, varies by post type
- May use lead paragraphs, callouts, embedded media

### Step 6: Generate Acknowledgements

Run the contributor script:

```bash
Rscript scripts/get_contributors.R "owner/repo"
```

Or with a specific starting tag for the previous version (or tag used for last release post):

```bash
Rscript scripts/get_contributors.R "owner/repo" "v1.0.0"
```

Copy the markdown output into the Acknowledgements section.

### Step 7: Review and Polish

Platform-agnostic checklist:

- [ ] Frontmatter complete with all required fields
- [ ] Opening clearly states package purpose
- [ ] Installation code block present (both languages if applicable)
- [ ] Sections organized logically
- [ ] Code examples use proper syntax highlighting
- [ ] Function names in backticks with parentheses: `` `function()` ``
- [ ] Package names are not backticked or otherwise styled
- [ ] Tone is conversational but not marketing-speak
- [ ] No superlatives ("powerful", "rich", "seamless", etc.)
- [ ] Features explained with context, not just listed
- [ ] Concepts explained before showing code
- [ ] All examples show R and Python variants (if applicable)
- [ ] Links to full release notes included

Platform-specific checklist:

**Tidyverse:**
- [ ] Slug format: `package-x-y-z` (hyphens, not dots)
- [ ] Photo URL and author included
- [ ] Acknowledgements section is final section
- [ ] All contributors listed alphabetically

**Shiny:**
- [ ] YAML anchors used for description (`&desc`, `*desc`)
- [ ] Social media cards configured (`open-graph`, `twitter-card`)
- [ ] Appropriate filters specified if using tabsets/shinylive
- [ ] Tabsets used for showing paired variants (Python/R, Express/Core)
- [ ] Multi-language tabsets used consistently (for R+Python packages only)

## Tips

- **Breaking changes first**: Put migration guides before features
- **Highlight the wins**: Lead with the most exciting features
- **Show don't tell**: Use code examples liberally
- **Link generously**: Help readers find more information
- **Keep it conversational**: Write like you're explaining to a colleague
- **Be authentic**: Enthusiasm should feel genuine, not marketing-speak
